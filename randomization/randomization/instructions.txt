1. Copy the folder "single_intersection_no_traffic" to repo
2. Change the path of the folder in the string in the python function "randomize_traffic" to the path of the folder single_intersection_no_traffic
3. When training use the .sumocfg file in the folder "single_intersection_no_traffic"
4. Call the function "randomize_traffic" before each episode.
5. Save the mean values of the 4 metrics (journey time, speed, time loss, waiting time) for each episode. This is so we can plot their change during training.
6. After training run the model on the old  .sumocfg file in the folder "single_intersection_random_trips" with the old traffic. Compute the mean of the 4 metrics as well as the VSSD and JTSD
7. If you could save the model (weights of the Neural Network) every 50 epochs that would be nice
8. Try to use a neural network with 100,100 as hidden layers, relu activation.
